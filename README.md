# DECISION-TREE-IMPLEMENTATION

# 🌳 Decision Tree Implementation

This project demonstrates a simple and clean implementation of a **Decision Tree Classifier** using Python and scikit-learn, all done in a Jupyter Notebook.

---

## 📘 What This Project Does

- Loads the **Iris dataset**
- Splits the dataset into training and testing sets
- Trains a Decision Tree Classifier using scikit-learn
- Makes predictions on test data
- Calculates and displays the model accuracy

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas

---

## 📁 Files

- `DECISIONTREEIMPLEMENTATION (1).ipynb` — the main notebook containing all steps

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install dependencies (if not already):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn

2. Open the notebook:jupyter notebook

3.Run each cell to see the model's training and prediction process.
